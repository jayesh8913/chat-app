 todo - make a live chat app which :-
        - take comments as input
        - displays over as normal chat app
        - has a cooldown limit for each person (i.e the user can't send msg until 30 sec)
        - every comment has a upvote and downvote button (so we'll have to store every upvoted and downvoted user in a array)
        - sorts the chat according to the popularity of the comment 
        - have an inmemory db (for now)
